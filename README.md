# Landing Page with Dynamic Navbar and Auto-Update Active Class

## Overview

This project features a **dynamic landing page** with a navigation bar (navbar) that automatically updates the **active class** based on the section currently visible in the viewport. As users scroll through the page, the corresponding navigation link is highlighted, making navigation easier and more intuitive. The project is designed with **JavaScript** and focuses on performance optimization, particularly minimizing unnecessary DOM manipulation.

### Purpose
The goal is to provide a seamless user experience with an efficient, dynamic navbar that updates in real-time as the user interacts with the page by scrolling. This approach is common in modern web applications and is useful for single-page websites or landing pages.
